\section{Introduction}
In the research field of modelling and verification we are interested in comparing model and specification.
We formalize both and use various techniques to check whether the model fulfills its specification.
These two techniques differ in the "language" we use for formalization.
Model and specification can be modeled in the same or in different languages.
We focus on the possibility of formalizing the model as a game that characterizes the moves for the processes and the specification by HML formulas.
Between a play of the game and a HML formula exist...
