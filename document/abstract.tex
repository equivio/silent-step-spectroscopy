\section{abstract}

We provide an Isabelle/HOL formalization of Bisping and Jansen's weak spectroscopy game, which can be used to decide a wide
array of behavioral equivalences between stability-respecting branching bisimilarity and weak trace equivalence in one go. 
We outline the proof of correctness by relating attacker-winning energy budgets and distinguishing sub 
languages of Hennessyâ€“Milner logic characterized by eight dimensions of formula expressiveness. 
We provide small but necessary adaptations to the game and the proof.
