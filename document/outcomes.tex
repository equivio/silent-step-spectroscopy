\section{Contributions to the Paper}
\begin{itemize}
\item The sixth inductive property of the lemma strategy\_formulas\_distinguish in \ref{deviation:lemma3} 
(lemma 3 in \cite{bisping2023lineartimebranchingtime}) was adjusted.
The case of $g=(p,\alpha ,p', Q- Q_\alpha, Q_\alpha)_d^\eta$ being a defender branching position
required adding the assumtions that $p \overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow} p'$ and $Q_\alpha \neq \emptyset$
to match those of the branching conjunction move rule (cf. \cite[p. 13]{bisping2023lineartimebranchingtime}). 

\item In the definition of the weak spectroscopy game in section \ref{specmoves} the moves were changed: 
The move `finishing' was removed. This move adjusted the cost of an empty immediate conjunction to be zero.
This is inconsistent with the definition of the expressiveness price. This move is also not needed, as in the case of $Q$ being an empty set at an attacker immediate position, the attacker can move to the corresponding
defender conjunction position by performing a `delay' move, followed by a `late instable conjunction' move. Both of these moves have zero costs.

\item The move empty\_stbl\_conj\_answer (moving from adefender stable conjunction position to a defender conjunction
position if $Q$ is empty) with costs $e_4$ was added. This is necessary for the proof of lemma 
winning\_budget\_implies\_strategy\_formula in section \ref{derivation:lemma3}. Before 
$e \in Win_a (p, \emptyset)_d^s $ was true for any energy (not equal to the defender\_win\_level), in particular $\bold{0}$. 
Since an empty stable conjuction has costs of $e_4$ no strategy formula with an appropriate price could be constructed. 
With the added move $e_4 \leq e $ holds true for any $e \in Win_a (p, \emptyset)_d^s $ and therefore resolves this issue.

\item In lemma strategy\_formulas\_distinguish in section \ref{derivation:lemma3} the case of $g$ being a defender branching position was adjusted: 
When considering $g=(p,\alpha ,p', Q- Q \alpha, Q \alpha)_d^\eta$ the conditions $p \overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow} p'$ and $Q \alpha \neq \emptyset$ were added.
