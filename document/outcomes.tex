\section{Contributions to the Paper}

\begin{itemize}
\item In the definition of the weak spectroscopy game in Section \ref{specmoves} the moves were changed: 
\\
The finishing move was removed. This move adjusted the cost of an empty immediate conjunction to be zero.
This is inconsistent with the definition of the expressiveness price. Also the move is not needed. In the 
case of an empty set $Q$ at an attacker (immediate) position the attacker can move to the corresponding 
defender conjunction position by first going delaying. These two moves combined actually have zero costs.
\\
The move empty\_stbl\_conj\_answer () was added.TODO
\item In lemma strategy\_formulas\_distinguish in Section \ref{derivation:lemma3} the case of $g$ being a defender branching position was adjusted: 
When considering $g=(p,\alpha ,p', Q- Q \alpha, Q \alpha)_d^\eta$ the conditions $p \overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow} p'$ and $Q \alpha \neq \emptyset$ were 
added.
