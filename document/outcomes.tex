\section{Contributions to the Paper}

\begin{itemize}
\item In the definition of the weak spectroscopy game in Section \ref{specmoves} the moves were changed: 
\\
The finishing move was removed. This move adjusted the cost of an empty immediate conjunction to be zero.
This is inconsistent with the definition of the expressiveness price. Also the move is not needed. In the 
case of an empty set $Q$ at an attacker (immediate) position the attacker can move to the corresponding 
defender conjunction position by first going delaying. These two moves combined actually have zero costs.
\\
The move empty\_stbl\_conj\_answer (moving from adefender stable conjunction position to a defender conjunction
position if $Q$ is empty) with costs $e_4$ was added. This is necessary for the proof of lemma 
winning\_budget\_implies\_strategy\_formula in section \ref{derivation:lemma3}. Before 
$e \in Win_a (p, \emptyset)_d^s $ was true for any energy (not equal to the defender\_win\_level), in particular $\bold{0}$. 
Since an empty stable conjuction has costs of $e_4$ no strategy formula with an appropriate price could be constructed. 
With the added move $e_4 \leq e $ holds true for any $e \in Win_a (p, \emptyset)_d^s $ and therefore resolves this issue.
\\
The changes of the weak sprectroscopy game impact the definition of strategy formulas. As shown in the proof 
of lemma winning\_budget\_implies\_strategy\_formula in section \ref{derivation:lemma3} our definition that is close 
to the paper still works. (For example one could choose to add a derivation rule corresponding to the move empty\_stbl\_conj\_answer to the definition 
of strategy formulas. We instead constructed the necessary formula in the proof and used that for an empty set the rule stable\_conj could be applied.
More detail is found in the proof in the case $Q=\emptyset$ in case 5 ($g$ being a defender stable conjunction position) 
of case 3 ($g$ being a defender position with successors).)
\item In lemma strategy\_formulas\_distinguish in Section \ref{derivation:lemma3} the case of $g$ being a defender branching position was adjusted: 
When considering $g=(p,\alpha ,p', Q- Q \alpha, Q \alpha)_d^\eta$ the conditions $p \overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow} p'$ and $Q \alpha \neq \emptyset$ were 
added.
