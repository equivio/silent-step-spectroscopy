\section{Contributions to the Paper}

\begin{itemize}
\item In \ref{derivation:lemma3} the case of $g$ being a defender branching position was adjusted: 
When considering $g=(p,\alpha ,p', Q- Q \alpha, Q \alpha)_d^\eta$ the conditions $p \overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow} p'$ and $Q \alpha \neq \emptyset$ are 
missing. 
\item In the proof of \ref{derivation:lemma3} case 2. "Due to rule (branching conj.)" needs to be 
rule (branch) and in case 6. $\varphi $ and $\varphi '$ are meant to be the same and should be 
written referenced constistently.
