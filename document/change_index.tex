\section{Index of Changes}

\begin{itemize}
    \item  In lemma winning\_budget\_implies\_strategy\_formula in \ref{derivation:lemma2} a different kind of induction is used compared to the paper 
where we only look at direct successors and therefore added the not too interesting case of g being an 
attacker branching position which was omitted in the paper.
\end{itemize}
