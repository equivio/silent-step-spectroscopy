   \item In \ref{derivation:lemma3} we added a case to account for the difference between 
conjunctions and immediate conjunctions. And due to our formalization when considering a
defender branching position $g=(p,\alpha ,p', Q \ Q\alpha, Q\alpha)_d^\eta$ the condition 
$Q \alpha \subseteq Q$ is implicitly given.
