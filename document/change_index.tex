\section{Index of Changes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In \ref{deviation:eneg} energies are extended to include a negative inhabitant. 
    \item  In lemma winning\_budget\_implies\_strategy\_formula in \ref{derivation:lemma2} a different kind of induction is used compared to the paper 
    where we only look at direct successors and therefore added the not too interesting case of g being an 
    attacker branching position which was omitted in the paper.
   \item In lemma strategy\_formulas\_distinguish in  \ref{derivation:lemma3} we added a case to account for the difference between 
conjunctions and immediate conjunctions. And due to our formalization when considering a
defender branching position $g=(p,\alpha ,p', Q - Q\alpha, Q\alpha)_d^\eta$ the condition 
$Q \alpha \subseteq Q$ is implicitly given.
  \item Since in our HML we distinguish between a conjunction and an immediate conjunction, in section \ref{stratFormula} 
we added a new strategy formula for immediate conjunction to the definition.
\end{itemize}
