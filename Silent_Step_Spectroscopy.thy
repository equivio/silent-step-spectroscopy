theorem spectroscopy_game_correctness:
  shows "(\<exists>\<phi> \<in> \<O> e. distinguishes_from \<phi> p Q)
       = (in_wina e (Attacker_Immediate p Q))"
proof
  assume "\<exists>\<phi>\<in>\<O> e. distinguishes_from \<phi> p Q"
  then obtain \<phi> where
    "distinguishes_from \<phi> p Q" and le: "expressiveness_price \<phi> \<le> e"
    unfolding \<O>_def by blast 
  from distinction_implies_winning_budgets this(1)
    have budget: "in_wina (expressiveness_price \<phi>) (Attacker_Immediate p Q)" .
  thus "in_wina e (Attacker_Immediate p Q)" using win_a_upwards_closure le by simp
next
  assume "in_wina e (Attacker_Immediate p Q)"
  with winning_budget_implies_strategy_formula
    have "\<exists>\<phi>. strategy_formula (Attacker_Immediate p Q) e \<phi> \<and> expressiveness_price \<phi> \<le> e" by force
  hence "\<exists>\<phi>\<in>\<O> e. strategy_formula (Attacker_Immediate p Q) e \<phi>" unfolding \<O>_def by blast
